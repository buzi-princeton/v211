title: 'ISAACS: Iterative Soft Adversarial Actor-Critic for Safety'
openreview: xw3SxLx_7AC
abstract: |
    The deployment of robots in uncontrolled environments requires them to operate 
    robustly under previously unseen scenarios, like irregular terrain and wind conditions. 
    Unfortunately, while rigorous safety frameworks from robust optimal control theory 
    scale poorly to high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, control policies computed by 
    more tractable “deep” methods lack guarantees and tend to exhibit little robustness 
    to uncertain operating conditions. This work introduces a novel approach enabling scalable 
    synthesis of robust safety-preserving controllers for robotic systems with general 
    nonlinear dynamics subject to bounded modeling error, by combining game-theoretic safety 
    analysis with adversarial reinforcement learning in simulation. Following a soft actor-
    critic scheme, a safety-seeking fallback policy is co-trained with an adversarial 
    “disturbance” agent that aims to invoke the worst-case realization of model error and 
    training-to-deployment discrepancy allowed by the designer’s uncertainty. While the 
    learned control policy does not intrinsically guarantee safety, it is used to construct a
    real-time safety filter with robust safety guarantees based on forward reachability 
    rollouts. This safety filter can be used in conjunction with a safety-agnostic control
    policy, precluding any task-driven actions that could result in loss of safety. We 
    evaluate our learning-based safety approach in a 5D race car simulator, compare the 
    learned safety policy to the numerically obtained optimal solution, and empiricall 
    validate the robust safety guarantee of our proposed safety filter against worst-case 
    model discrepancy.
